# 601LyftProject
## Product Definition
### Product Mission
  To improve the quality of life by optimizing self-driving technology, which can lead to fewer accidents and easier commutes. 3D object detection over semantic maps is a primary problem in the development of autonomous driving technologies, so the product mission is to use machine learning techniques to improve this object detection. We do this by predicting the bounding volume of all the objects in a given scene/picture and classifying them into different classes. 

### Target User(s): 
  This product in particular is being developed for a specific client/target user- Lyft. Apart from Lyft, any company which is looking to manufacture, sell or use automated self-driving cars, such as Tesla, Uber, Toyota etc. would benefit from this product. 
### User Stories
  3D object detection over sematic maps is used by many different people in different fields. 
  I, Lyft, would like a software to improve autonomous driving capabilities by reducing the number of accidents.
  I, Lyft, would like to use only the raw camera sensor inputs in order to facilitate autonomous driving, without any other sensors. 
  I, the car manufacturer, would like a software that can be used in a range of autonomous vehicles, with little modifications. 
  I, Lyft, would like a software that can differentiate between different types of vehicles, living and non living objects, and traffic     signs. 
  I, Lyft, would like a software that can accurately tell me the bounding volume, center, width, length and height of a given object in     the picture. 
  I, Lyft, would like a software that can accurately classify all the given objects in a picture into different categories. 
  I, a robotics developer, would like a software that can be used by a robot to build a semantically annotated 3D map in real time, to       improve robot-human interactions
  I, the researcher, would like a software that can automatically annotate/label a picture so I may classify objects of interest to me. 

  
### MVP
  An algorithm which can perform 3D object detection (by returning the volume of the object) over semantic maps (by returning the classification of the object) 
### User Interface Design for main user story if required
  Since this is an algorithm that is to be developed, there is no user interface because it is not a product. This algorithm would be programmed into an autonomous car, and the car would act as the user interface between our algorithm and the driver.     

## Technology may used
  Opencv, Machine Learning, Python.
